"Ah, that you? Ready for serious business? Yeah, yeah. Scary character you, scarier than me, haha. To be short, the tourists are sort of bugging me lately... Meddle everywhere, waste my people. I don’t like it. I’ll fix you up with some top cash if you raise some hell with them. And get some of their gear while you’re at it, their chest rigs and backpacks are selling well, I hear."
